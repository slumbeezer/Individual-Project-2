					<h4 class="header1">December 26, 1791 - October 18, 1871</h4>
					<p class="text1">Charles Babbage was one of four children to Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape. Charles father,
						Benjamin, was a banking partner in the founding of Praed’s & Co. Around age eight Charles was sent to a school in Alphington,
						England to recover from a life threating illness. He also attended King Edward VI Grammar School for a short period
						before his health forced him to learn with private tutors. Later Babbage joined Holmwood Academy. This was the beginning
						of Charles passion for mathematics. He later started schooling at the University of Cambridge in 1810. He was self-taught
						in contemporary mathematics and was disappointed in the mathematical instruction at the university. In 1814, Babbage
						married Georgiana Whitmore. They had eight children, only three of which lived past childhood. Whitmore died in 1827.
						He never remarried.In 1816, Babbage was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He assited in founding the Astronomical Society
						in 1820. In 1824 he won the gold medal for the Astronomical Society for his invention of the difference engine. He
						taught as a Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University from 1828 to 1839. He died on October 18, 1871.</p>

					<h1 class="header1">Ada Lovelace</h1>
					<h4 class="header1">December 10, 1815 - November 27, 1852</h4>
					<p class="text1">Ada Lovelace was the only legitimate child of an English poet named Lord Byron. From a young age she
						had a gift for mathematics which was pushed further by her mother who gave her a private tutor from an early age. Her
						mother wanted to make sure she did not follow her father’s footsteps to become a poet as she believed it was the reason
						for his “insanity”. Her father left English only a few months after she was born and never saw him again. He died in
						the Greek War of Independence from disease whilst leading a campaign in said war. Ada’s upbringing in mathematics was
						a very unusual occurrence for an aristocratic girl in the mid 1800s. Around age 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, an inventor
						and mathematician. The two became friends and Babbage became somewhat of a mentor to Ada. Thanks to Babbage she began
						studying advanced mathematics with a professor from the University of London by the name of Augustus de Morgan. In
						1835 she married William King-Noel. They had three children together. In her later years, Lovelace attempted to make
						calculations to win in gambling. However, she never was able to succeed and ended up in debt. She died from uterine
						cancer on November 27, 1852.</p>
